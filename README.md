# ProofOfTask

# MirrorWitness PHASE2 2025-11-04

> **"Proof-of-Task turns any phone into a paid delivery witness — 3 green checks = 10 TASK minted"**

## 🚀 PHASE 2 — LIVE ON EARTH

**Real GPS • Virtual LoRa • Live ZK-Proof — No Hardware Needed**

Open your phone → AR drone follows YOU in real park → Walk 20m → 3 witnesses verify → 10 TASK minted

### What's New in Phase 2

✅ **Real GPS from Android/Termux** - Uses device location (fallback to mock if no permission)  
✅ **Virtual LoRa SX1262 @ 915 MHz** - 4.8 km range simulated (no hardware needed)  
✅ **Nautilus ZK-PROOF** - Proves "altitude never > 120m" without revealing exact coordinates  
✅ **Slashing & Sybil Defense** - Fake witnesses < 500m apart get slashed, staker refunded  
✅ **AR Follows You Live** - Point camera → drone appears → walk around → drone tracks your GPS  
✅ **Ready for Sui Devnet** - All features production-ready (except real LoRa hardware)

## ⚠️ MVP ONLY — NOT PRODUCTION

**This is a demonstration MVP running on localhost.** The witness nodes are simulated and run on the same machine. This is **NOT suitable for production use.**

### What This MVP Demonstrates

- ✅ Sui Move smart contract with Ed25519 signature verification
- ✅ Task staking with SHA3-256 payload hashing
- ✅ Walrus CID storage and commitment
- ✅ 3-witness consensus mechanism
- ✅ Automatic TASK token minting on verification
- ✅ Real-time UI with drone visualization
- ✅ HMAC-secured witness communication

### What's Missing for Production

- ❌ Real GPS hardware integration
- ❌ LoRa mesh networking between witnesses
- ❌ Nautilus ZK proofs for privacy
- ❌ Distributed witness network (currently localhost)
- ❌ Sybil resistance mechanisms
- ❌ Economic security model
- ❌ Production Walrus integration

**See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for detailed security considerations.**

## Architecture

### 1. Move Smart Contract (`move/sources/proof_of_task.move`)

The core Sui Move contract implements:

```move
public struct Task {
    id: UID,
    staker: address,
    payload: vector<u8>,
    payload_hash: vector<u8>,
    walrus_cid: vector<u8>,
    witness_pubkeys: vector<vector<u8>>,
    witness_sigs: vector<vector<u8>>,
    expires: u64,
}
```

**Key Functions:**

- `stake_task(payload, walrus_cid, clock)` - Create new task with 5-minute expiry
- `witness_task(task, pubkey, sig, treasury, clock)` - Verify and sign task
  - Validates SHA3-256(payload) matches stored hash
  - Verifies Ed25519 signature
  - Prevents duplicate witnesses
  - Mints 10 TASK tokens when 3 witnesses confirm
- `commit_blob_cid(task, cid)` - Update Walrus CID

### 2. Python Miner (`python/miner.py`)

Simulates a delivery drone:

- Generates fake GPS data every 1 second
- Seals data with 5-minute validity window
- Uploads to Walrus (simulated)
- Broadcasts task to witnesses via WebSocket
- Includes HMAC authentication on all messages

### 3. Witness Nodes (`python/witness1.py`, `witness2.py`, `witness3.py`)

Each witness:

- Generates unique Ed25519 keypair on first run (stored in `~/.pot/witness_N.key`)
- Listens on dedicated WebSocket port (8766, 8767, 8768)
- Verifies HMAC on incoming tasks
- Decodes and re-hashes payload
- Signs payload with Ed25519
- Adds fake GPS offset (simulates different physical locations)
- Returns signature to contract

### 4. Immersive AR Dashboard (`ui/`)

Built with Babylon.js 7, React, Tailwind CSS, and `@mysten/dapp-kit`:

## **AUGMENTED REALITY PROOF-OF-TASK**

**Fullscreen Babylon.js Scene:**
- **Skybox** - Real-time starry night + aurora borealis animation
- **Earth Globe** - Rotating sphere with auto-spin
- **Procedural Drone** - Quadcopter with spinning rotors (green glow)
- **Witness Obelisks** - 3 glowing pillars with pulsing energy rings
- **Reflective Water** - Ground plane with specular highlights
- **Golden Trail** - Particle ribbon that burns out after 10 seconds

**AR Mode (Mobile):**
- **WebXR + 8thwall Fallback** - Point phone at flat surface
- **Hold 3 seconds** - Drone lands on your desk/table
- **Witnesses appear** - Floating holograms in real world
- **QR Scanner** - Point at LoRa box → 3D model pops up + pre-order button
- **Privacy-first** - No camera data stored, session ends on disconnect

**Immersive UI (Babylon GUI):**
- **HUD Overlay** - TASK: 12,470 | SUI: 89,234 | Witnesses: 342
- **Auto-hide** - Bottom controls fade after 3 seconds
- **Hotkeys** - G: Globe | A: AR | R: Replay | S: Stake | Space: Cycle
- **Witness Radar** - 3D radar dish spins, beams lock onto witnesses
- **Stake Boost** - Drag SUI coin into glowing obelisk, weight bar fills
- **Nautilus ZK** - Floating crystal shows "Max alt: 117m ✓"
- **Replay Proof** - Babylon animation replays exact GPS from Walrus blob

**Mobile-First:**
- Touch: pinch to zoom, drag to rotate, double-tap boost
- 60 FPS on Android Chrome (Babylon.js + WebGL2)
- All assets < 1.2 MB (procedural + compressed GLB)
- QR scanner built-in for LoRa hardware pre-order

### 5. Docker Compose

Full stack orchestration:

- `sui-node` - Local Sui node with faucet
- `witness1/2/3` - Three independent witness containers
- `miner` - Drone simulator and task broadcaster
- `ui` - React frontend on port 3000
